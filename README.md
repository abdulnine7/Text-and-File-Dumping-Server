# Text and Files Dumping Server
`HTML PHP Server`

**This code is made to dump any text of file into one's own server at any time at any place.**

This is coded keeping in mind security of the text and file on the server(Only server admin can access this data while anyone can dump).

This code is made mainly for students who many a times forget to carry storage media to college and may loose or compromise security of important codes and data they may be working on by putting transfering it on unreliable storages available. One can easily open link and upload data on one's own server.

This can also be use for taking assignments by the teacher in colleges and schools.
